Encryption : This code snippet demonstrates a simple encryption and decryption process for an image file using XOR operation. It first prompts the user to input the path of the image file and the encryption key. Then, it reads the image file, converts its data into a byte array, and performs XOR operation on each byte with the encryption key. After encryption, it writes the encrypted data back to the image file, effectively encrypting it. In case any exception occurs during the process, it catches the exception and prints a generic error message along with the name of the exception. However, there are a few improvements that could be made, such as handling specific exceptions separately for better error handling and providing clearer instructions to the user.


Decryptiom: This Python script performs a simple decryption process for an image file encrypted using XOR operation with a given key. It first prompts the user to input the path of the encrypted image file and the decryption key. Then, it reads the encrypted image file, converts its data into a byte array, and performs XOR operation on each byte with the decryption key. After decryption, it writes the decrypted data back to the image file, effectively decrypting it. However, there's a discrepancy in the comments where it says "Key for decryption", but it's actually used for encryption. Additionally, it might be beneficial to include error handling for cases where the input key is not an integer or the file path is invalid.
